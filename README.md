# ODB2 with ELM327

## Intro
This app is a playground for communicating with the [ELM327](https://www.elmelectronics.com/products/ics/obd/) connected to an ODB CAN bus.

The goal is to learn more about the CAN on my Triumph 1200 XRT, communicating over serial on the browser, learning new technologies liek React/Redux, and most importantly, having some fun.

## Launch the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Credits

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

This app was originally created watching the [Build a iMessage Clone with REACT.JS for Beginners! (with REDUX)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF65cySUYao) by [Clever Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqrILQNl5Ed9Dz6CGMyvMTQ).  *Incredibly fun to build an app this way*.
